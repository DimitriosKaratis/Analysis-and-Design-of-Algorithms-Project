## Problem Descriptions and Solutions

### ðŸ”¹ Problem 1: Graph Connectivity with Fuel Constraints

**Task**: Design algorithms to determine if travel between cities is feasible given fuel tank limitations.

#### Question 1: Route Existence
**Problem**: Given a graph of cities connected by roads with specific lengths, determine if there exists a feasible route from city `s` to city `t` with a fuel tank capacity `L`.

**Approach**:
- **Graph Preprocessing**: Remove all edges (roads) with length > L before applying search algorithms
- **Algorithm**: Modified Breadth-First Search (BFS) on the filtered graph
- **Logic**: If city `t` remains unvisited (white) after BFS completion, no feasible route exists

**Key Insights**:
- Simplification through edge filtering reduces problem complexity
- BFS naturally explores all reachable vertices within fuel constraints
- **Time Complexity**: O(|V| + |E|) - same as standard BFS

#### Question 2: Minimum Tank Capacity
**Problem**: Find the minimum fuel tank capacity required to travel from city `s` to city `t`.

**Approach**:
- **Preliminary Check**: Use Dijkstra's algorithm to verify connectivity
- **Core Algorithm**: Modified Prim's MST algorithm focusing on bottleneck edges
- **Strategy**: Track maximum edge weight in the MST path from `s` to `t`

**Key Insights**:
- Problem reduces to finding the bottleneck edge in the optimal path
- MST properties ensure minimal maximum edge weight
- Greedy selection of minimum edges leads to optimal solution
- **Time Complexity**: O((|V| + |E|)log|V|) using binary heap

### ðŸ”¹ Problem 2: Citizen Service Queue Optimization

**Task**: Minimize total waiting time for citizens requiring government services.

**Problem**: Given `n` citizens with different service times, determine the optimal service order to minimize total waiting time across all citizens.

**Approach**:
- **Strategy**: Shortest Processing Time First (SPT) - serve citizens in ascending order of service time
- **Algorithm**: Sort citizens by service time, then process in order
- **Proof Method**: Proof by contradiction showing any deviation increases total cost

**Mathematical Proof**:
- Demonstrated that swapping any two citizens in non-optimal order increases total waiting time
- For citizens with service times `t_i < t_{i+1}`, serving `t_i` first saves `(t_{i+1} - t_i)` units of total waiting time
- Proved optimality through adjacent swap analysis

**Key Insights**:
- Greedy approach yields globally optimal solution
- Each local optimization (shortest job first) contributes to global minimum
- **Time Complexity**: Dominated by sorting - O(n log n) using mergesort

### ðŸ”¹ Problem 3: Optimal String Segmentation

**Task**: Find minimum computational cost to cut a string into specified segments.

**Problem**: Given a string of length `n` and `m` required cut positions, determine the minimum cost sequence of cuts where each cut costs the length of the current segment being cut.

**Approach**:
- **Technique**: Dynamic Programming with optimal substructure
- **State Definition**: `C[i,j]` = minimum cost to make all required cuts between positions `P[i]` and `P[j]`
- **Recurrence**: `C[i,j] = min{P[j] - P[i] + C[i,k] + C[k,j]}` for all valid cut positions `k`

**Algorithm Design**:
- Extended cut position array to include boundaries (0 and n)
- Bottom-up computation filling cost matrix diagonally
- Base cases: adjacent positions have zero cost (no cuts possible)

**Key Insights**:
- Problem exhibits optimal substructure: optimal solution contains optimal solutions to subproblems
- Order of cuts affects total cost due to changing segment lengths
- Dynamic programming captures all possible cut sequences efficiently
- **Time Complexity**: O(mÂ³) - similar to matrix chain multiplication
